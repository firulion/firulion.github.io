About me

Concluding my undergraduate studies in electronic engineering, I am a cybersecurity enthusiast currently engaged as a researcher in this field at UTFPR (Federal University of Technology - Paraná), where I am involved in developing extension projects focused on penetration testing.

As a penetration tester, my goal is to stay up to date with the latest threats and vulnerabilities operating in the market, always pursuing to expand my knowledge to be able to help others, and one day, become a reference in the field.
